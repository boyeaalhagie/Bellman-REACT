ðŸ“Œ ## **Project Overview**

The Shortest Flight Path Algorithm is a web-based application designed to compute the optimal flight route between two airports based on multiple factors like distance, layovers, and potential extensions for time and cost considerations. The algorithm leverages the Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate the shortest path and integrates an interactive user interface for validation and visualization of flight paths.

## Installation instructions
Before running the frontend, you'll want to install [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and make sure `npm` is installed as well. `npm` should be bundled with the `NodeJS` installer.


## How to use the project
To run the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following commands:
```bash 
npm install
npm start
```
This will start the frontend on `localhost:3000`.

To run the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory and run the the following commands.
```bash 
npm install
node app.js
```
This will start the backend on `localhost:5000`.
